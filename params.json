{"body":"### Course Synopsis\r\n\r\nThis course is designed to provide students the fundamental skills for effective statistical programming. Students will learn to use R (a statistical programming language) and STATA (a commercial statistics package) for data manipulation, summarization and analysis. Topics will include programming syntax and data structures, generation of scientific graphics, writing functions, debugging and testing, programming paradigms, simulation and optimization. Students will also be introduced to LaTeX, Markdown and knitr for report writing, version control using Git, and basic SQL programming.\r\n\r\nPrerequisites: Some introductory undergraduate statistics or permission of instructor.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Instructor\r\n\r\nChris Fonnesbeck, PhD, Instructor of Biostatistics\r\n\r\nT-2303 Medical Center North\r\n\r\nchris.fonnesbeck@vanderbilt.edu\r\n\r\n\r\n### Schedule\r\n\r\n* Lectures: Mondays, 1-3pm in [RLH 412](http://goo.gl/maps/4c3W)\r\n* Office hours: By appointment\r\n\r\n### Textbook and reading materials\r\n\r\nRecommended Text:\r\n\r\n![The Art of R Programming](http://nostarch.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/product_main_page/R_cvr_front.png)\r\n\r\n[The Art of R Programming](http://nostarch.com/artofr.htm): Norman Matloff\r\n\r\n\r\n### Essential Software\r\n\r\nThe following software packages are required.
